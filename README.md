# odin-recipes-project
A project to make a Recipe Website Using HTML. I will demonstrate
my knowledge in HTML, showing my mastery of tags, elements, attributes
and more! I will also show my knowledge of absolute and relative linking.
How to use lists, the image tag and my website architecture will also be tested.

In this project I learned a great amount about using Git, GitHub and how to use BASH to do EVERYTHING. I practiced my HTML as said above, learned some new things like underlining and the correct way to use absolute and relative linking. I used my knowledge of "Committing Like a Pro" extensively in this project. Overall, very fun project!
